# UI Redesign Challenge: From "Unproper UI" to "Proper UI "
> **Volunteer Selection for a Startup â€“ Mockup Trial Design Challenge**


## Overview

This project documents the transformation of a flawed original interface ("Unproper UI") into a modern, intuitive, and visually engaging design ("Proper UI") using Figma. The redesign addresses core usability issues, enhances clarity, and provides a scalable foundation for future development.

## The Challenge: "Unproper UI"

The original user interface suffered from several usability and visual design issues:

- **Confusing User Flow:** Multiple redundant buttons created uncertainty about the correct action to take.
- **Poor Information Hierarchy:** Club cards presented information in a disorganized manner, making it difficult for users to find key details.
- **Outdated Visual Style:** The overall look and feel lacked clarity and did not engage users.

## The Solution: "Proper UI"

The redesign process focused on usability, clarity, and aesthetics. Key improvements include:

- **Streamlined User Flow:** Each item now features a single, clear call-to-action, eliminating confusion and simplifying the decision-making process.
- **Redesigned Information Cards:** Club cards have been restructured to highlight the most important details upfront, improving information hierarchy and scannability.
- **Modern Visual Aesthetic:** The interface uses a consistent layout, cohesive color palette, and improved typography for a clean, contemporary look.
- **Reusable Components:** Components were built for consistency and scalability, ensuring maintainability and faster iteration in the future.

- ## Technologies
- **Design Tool:** Figma

- ## Getting Started

If you wish to extend or implement this design:

1. Open the Figma file (link below).
2. Review the component library for consistency.
3. Follow the layout, color, and typographic guidelines for new screens or features.
