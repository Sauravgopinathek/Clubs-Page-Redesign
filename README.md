##The Challenge (The "Unproper UI"):
The original design had several key usability issues, including:
->A confusing user flow with redundant buttons.
->Poor information hierarchy on the club card.
->A dated visual style that lacked clarity and appeal.

##The Solution (The "Proper UI"):
I redesigned the screen from the ground up using Figma, with a focus on creating an intuitive and visually engaging interface. The final design features:
->A streamlined user flow with a single, clear call-to-action per item.
->Redesigned information cards that present key details upfront.
->A modern and clean aesthetic using a consistent layout, color palette, and typography.
->Reusable components for consistency and scalability.
